Package
---------
A directory of Go code can have at most one package.
By convention, we name our package the same as the directory.
All .go files in a single directory must all belong to the same package.
Directory of Go code that's all compiled together.

Module
---------
A repository contains one or more modules.
A module is a collection of Go packages that are released together.

Go Build
---------
One of the beauties of Go is that you always go build for production,
 and because the output is a statically compiled binary,
 you can ship it to production or end users without them needing the Go toolchain installed.

Go Install
---------
Compiles and installs a package or packages on your local machine for your personal usage.
It installs the package's compiled binary in the GOBIN directory.
