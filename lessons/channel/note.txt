Channel
---------
- Channels are a typed, thread-safe queue.
- Channels allow different goroutines to communicate with each other.

Send data to a channel
------------------------
- eg: ch <- 69
- The <- operator is called the channel operator.
- Data flows in the direction of the arrow.
- This operation will block until another goroutine is ready to receive the value.

Receive data from a channel
------------------------
- eg: v := <-ch
- This reads and removes a value from the channel and saves it into the variable v.
- This operation will block until there is a value in the channel to be read.

Blocking and deadlocks
------------------------
- A deadlock is when a group of goroutines are all blocking so none of them can continue.
- This is a common bug that you need to watch out for in concurrent programming.
