Type Definition

- In Go, we don't have these nice things. We embrace the Grug mentality. The closest thing we have to a union type is a type definition:
- eg:
        type sendingChannel string

        const (
            Email sendingChannel = "email"
            SMS   sendingChannel = "sms"
            Phone sendingChannel = "phone"
        )

        func sendNotification(ch sendingChannel, message string) {
            // send the message
        }
